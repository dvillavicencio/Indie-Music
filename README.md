# Indie-Music Website
This small website is a personal project of mine to first, practice my web development skills as I learn about HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript while also 
  learning new frameworks that go along with them, and secondly, to invest my software development skills into someting I like: music. Any recommendations on
  what I can do better on my project is always welcome, however, I strictly do not allow other developers to contribute to this project.
  

### TODO (everchanging):
1. Decide on the layout of the website better
2. Connect to the spotify API for showcasing the songs of various artists
3. Design the user modules of the website
