<h1>Indie Music</h1>
<input id="indierock" type="button" value="Indie Rock Music" />
<p>One topic that I find interesting in particular, for example, is discovering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music#:~:text=Independent%20music%20(often%20referred%20to,approach%20to%20recording%20and%20publishing." target="_blank">Indie</a> Artists and listening to their music. I have spent hours upon hours searching for good Indie Music on popular music platforms such as <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.<br>
Recently, I have listening to two very good artists named <strong>Roosevelt</strong> and <strong>Cannons</strong>. Both of them make great music and their styles have captivated me enough to listen to their songs on repeat for almost a month now.</p>
<h2>Roosevelt</h2>

Roosevelt's latest album has drawn my attention because of its groovy 80s-90s style, sometimes it sounds like is a band playing, nonetheless, he makes the music all by himself!</p>
