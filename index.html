<h1 class="title">Indie Music</h1>
<p>
	One topic that I find interesting in particular, for example, is discovering
	<a id="wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music#:~:text=Independent%20music%20(often%20referred%20to,approach%20to%20recording%20and%20publishing." target="_blank">Indie</a>
	Artists and listening to their music. I have spent hours upon hours searching for good Indie Music on popular music platforms such as
	<a id="spotify" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.
	Recently, I have listening to two very good artists named Roosevelt and Cannons. Both of them make
	great music and their styles have captivated me enough to listen to their songs on repeat for almost a month now.

Roosevelt's latest album has drawn my attention because of its groovy 80s-90s style, sometimes it sounds like is a band playing, nonetheless, he makes the music all by himself!</p>
